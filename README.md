# cli_card_game
A Card game built using Lua and translated to Python about two thirds of the way through the project.

The lua version of the project is not fully functional. There are a number of bugs and I did not 
finish building it out in Lua once I started using Python. The Python version should work perfectly fine.

In order to play the game simply download the python version, open up terminal or shell, navigate to the 
folder the file is saved in and run the file using python3 pymonster.py

Please let me know what you think!
